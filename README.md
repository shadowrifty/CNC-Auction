Rules and guidlines for the CNC server


CNC Sub Auction: Rules and procedures 

Number one rule: A sub may withdraw consent at any time. Even 2 seconds after an auction is complete. It does not matter! 


Summary: This is a member driven event. The moderators have no responsibility, nor are they required to go above and beyond their duties to support this event. This is a member run, member attended event. 

In the Back room of the bar, every so often, when there is desire, we hold the fabled sub auction. Where Sirs can compete for a contract with a sub for the duration of a week. This event is designed to get people playing with those they would not normally and get people out of lurking. This is purely designed to be fun. All server rules still apply including consent and DM rules. 


How it works:

The event will be announced with enough advanced warning that everyone who desires to may attend. I recommend 1 week of advanced notice. 

The day before the auction the block will be decided. Every sub who wishes to participate will submit to the auctioneer their intro, and services offered. It may also be a good idea to list availability and time zone. 

Example Intro: 
This sub humbly provides this intro for her prospective bidders. This sub is a happy, bubbly, friendly little sub who will serve you well. Her thin, well manicured body is happy to serve you in the bar, bring you coffee when you enter the server, kneel at your feet whenever you like, and will happily gaze at you with love and devotion for the length of her contract. This subs time zone is….and my availability is… 

This subs limits are: 
Play in DM’s may be negotiated at this subs discretion.
NSFW play is on the table, but this sub would like to negotiate up front with her new sir about it. 


The day of, the auctioneer will organize and order the subs to be auctioned and post the list and the order. This should be done at least 2 hours before the auction so everyone can browse the 
Thank you for considering this humble sub, and happy bidding. 

goods. It is advised that the subs to be auctioned be available for prospective bidders to pursue them. This would be a fun roleplay opportunity. 

When the auction is due to begin the auctioneer will announce the opening with a gavel and all side chatter will be kept to a minimum. If at any time things are too wild the auctioneer may end the auction as they see fit. The subs will be auctioned in order from lowest to highest item number. 

Auctioning off a sub:

1. The auctioneer will announce the item number and paste the subs information.
2. The sub will post an entrance to the block.
3. Any sir who wishes to bid on the subs service declares their bid. (Note a Sir can only win a single auction, and can only bid on three subs per auction. This is to make sure Sirs are not bidding on just anyone. The auctioneer can alter these guidelines on the day of to adjust for bidders and or subs participating. For example if there are 15 subs and only 4 Sirs, it may be fun to alter these rules.) 

4. The auctioneer counts up the participants and announces The roll off. 
5. All bidders roll 1d20. The bidders who rolled the lowest are eliminated and the remaining bidders roll again. This continues until there is only a single bidder, who then wins the contract. If there is a tie, or any other situation where the outcome is unclear, the auctioneer makes a call. Sometimes life is not fair. 

Example: There are 8 bidders. The 4 bidders who roll highest remain and the 4 bidders who roll lowest are out. 

Alternative: If rolling is not an option there is an alternative system. The item on auction picks a number between 1 and 50 The bidders all choose a number, preferably one not chosen and the bidders who chose the closest number to the one chosen by the sub are the winners. Still cutting the bidder pool in half every time until there is a single winner. 

6. Repeat for every item up for auction. 


Some things to remember. 

1. This is primarily a roleplay event. Please keep that in mind while participating in the auction and afterward. There is no way to enforce a contract, Mods will not enforce them, nobody can make a sub do anything. Consent can be withdrawn at any time. 

2. It is heavily advised that the auction winner and the item immediately begin negotiation so there is no miscommunications, or issues for the duration of the contract.
